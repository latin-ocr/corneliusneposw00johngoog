Cimon, the son of Miltiades, was married to his own
sister, Elpinice by name. He says that he will not suf·
fer the name of the tyrant to bo protectcd by his [i. e.
the speaker’s] popularity. His dutiae as ambassador are
so faithfully executed by Dion, that the tyrant's most
cruel name is protectad by his popularity. It cannot be
denied that Dionysius is much influenced by the advice
of Dion. How few are there (Pr. Intr. 477), who un·
dertalre the post of ambassador with active-readiness,
and execute its duties with fidelity. Though Dionysius
was much influenced by Dion's advice, ye't in this mat·
ter, his own private feeling was strongar.
